Hi there, I'm Rahul, a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitrpr.ac.in), [IIT Ropar](https://www.iitrpr.ac.in/) working on problems in Reinforcement Learning with [Dr Shashi Shekhar Jha](https://sites.google.com/view/shashi-iitrpr/). My PhD thesis titled "Addressing Sim2Real Gap: Safe Policy Transfer" includes Model-based RL that improves sample efficiency; Safe RL that reduces safety violations in real environment by promoting safe exploration; Sim2Real Policy Adaptation; Exploration startegies that minimize the real world interaction for Sim2Real Policy Adaptation; Control theoretic perspective for Sim2Real Safe Policy Transfer. <br/><br/>
My research interests include bias mitigation in MBRL and its evaluation on MuJoCo complex continous control environments, minimizing the cost of the interaction with the real world by improving sample efficiency and safety.<br/><br/>
You can reach me at syam[dot]21csz0018[at]iitrpr[dot]ac[dot]in or locate me in [SARAS](https://www.cse.iitrpr.ac.in) Lab, IIT Ropar.
