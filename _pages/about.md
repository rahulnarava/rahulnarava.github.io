Hi there, I'm Rahul, a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitrpr.ac.in), [IIT Ropar](https://www.iitrpr.ac.in/) working on problems in Reinforcement Learning. My PhD thesis titled "Towards Reliable, Safe and Efficient Reinforcement Learning" includes Model-based RL that improves sample efficiency; Safe RL that reduces safety violations in real environment by promoting safe exploration; Sim2Real Policy Adaptation; Exploration strategies that minimize the real world interaction for Sim2Real Policy Adaptation; Control theoretic perspective for Sim2Real Safe Policy Transfer. <br/><br/>
My research interests include bias mitigation in MBRL, Safe Policy Transfer by minimizing the cost of the interaction with the real world by improving sample efficiency and safety.<br/><br/>
You can reach me at syam[dot]21csz0018[at]iitrpr[dot]ac[dot]in or locate me in 208 (https://www.cse.iitrpr.ac.in) Lab, IIT Ropar.
